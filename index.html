    <p>Frequently Asked Questions</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-box">
    <h3>How and why does Pineal XT work?</h3>
    <p>Pineal XT contains nine powerful natural ingredients that have been perfectly combined to
    support a healthy prostate, kidneys and urinary tract well into old age, while withstanding any
    threat or external attack that might compromise their normal functioning.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-box">
    <h3>Is Pineal XT right for me?</h3>
    <p>All of the ingredients inside of Pineal XT have been constantly tested for purity and to ensure
    against toxins and contaminants. Moreover, Pineal XT is manufactured in an FDA-approved
    facility, under sterile, strict and precise standards. </p>
    <p>With more than 160,000 customers, we haven’t seen any notable side effects. So, we’re
    confident in saying that Pineal XT is one of the purest prostate formulas you’ll find on the
    market.</p>
    <p>As always, if you currently have a medical condition or you’re taking other prescription
      medication, we advise you to show a bottle of Pineal XT to your doctor before you take it, just
      to put your mind at ease.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-box">
    <h3>When and how should I take Pineal XT?</h3>
    <p>We recommend you take two full droppers (2 ml) per day, preferably in the morning. You can
    pour it directly into your mouth or put it into your tea, coffee, juice or any other beverage you
    enjoy. Just make sure to shake the bottle well first, so the ingredients can combine into an extra
    potent mix!</p>
    </div>
  <div class="faq-box">
    <h3>What if it doesn't work for me? Can you tell me about the guarantee again?</h3>
    <p>The more results we see, the stronger we believe Pineal XT has the power to completely
      support the health of your prostate and urinary system. It's true, though, that nothing works for
      100% of the people who try it as each body works in its own way.</p>
      <p>That's why every bottle of Pineal XT comes with an ironclad 60-day money back guarantee. If,
      for any reason, you aren't fully satisfied with the results, you can just return what you haven't
      used for a full, no question asked refund.</p>
